          Forests are complex ecosystems that provide a wide and dynamic array of environmental and socioeconomic benefits and services. The essential aim of sustainable forest management is to maintain the broad range of forest values in perpetuity.

                  <h2> Total Count per Year per State </h2>
             Between the years of 2000 and 2016, the number of endangered forests across Australia rose to 59. When separated by states, it becomes evident that the greatest number of engandered forests are in New South Wales. 
                <br>
            Few forests were classified between the years 2002 and 2005, and there was a large number of classifications between the years 2006 and 2010. There was a large increase in Victoria in 2009, the number of classified forests doubling in that time.

                  <h2> Reasons for Being Classified </h2>
             Of the three listed EPBC catergories, there is a spread in which reasons result in which classification. 
                 <br>
            There is a great concern in that the primary classification is 'critically endangered', always being the highest value bar three expections. 
                 <br>
            Of all causes, many are natural processes not due to human efforts. However, many of these could be prevented with the aid of human intervention, such as efforts to reduce weeds, monitoring non native species, and reducing the risk of bush fires. 
                 <br>
            Many processes are due to humans, without a change the upward trend in endangered forest count will continue.

                    There are a number of reasons that are documented when a forest is classified. While there is no one reason that is the primary cause, there are some that are more common than others.

         As forests across Australia are depleated, it is important to understand which states have the greatest number of forests at risk, and what the main causes for depleation are. While we understand that New South Wales has the greatest number of endangered forests, and the number one cause of it is agriculture, there is still a lot of factors to consider if Australia is maintain its rich variety of fauna.
